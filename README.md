# asymmetry-of-serial-position-effect
The study about the asymmetry of serial position effect in the item recall with order probe and the order recall with item probe.

The experiment 1 is finished, the data shown the serial position effect from both tasks go in the same direction. 
The experiment 2 changes the recall procedure from single recall to multiple recalls. The data collection is still on going.

The study will also include several models try to simulate the result.
